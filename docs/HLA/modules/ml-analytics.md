Use `StrategyComparator` to compare multiple strategy analytics objects:

```python
from src.analytics.advanced_analytics import StrategyComparator

comparator = StrategyComparator()
comparator.add_strategy("RSI_BB", analytics_a)
comparator.add_strategy("HMM_LSTM", analytics_b)

comparison_df = comparator.compare_strategies()
rankings = comparator.rank_strategies()
```

## HMM-LSTM Backtesting — Parameters & Integration

The HMM-LSTM backtesting system integrates regime detection (HMM) with log-return price prediction (LSTM) into a single Backtrader strategy.

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config/optimizer/p01_hmm_lstm.json` | Main backtesting config |
| `src/backtester/optimizer/hmm_lstm.py` | Backtesting entry point |
| `src/strategy/hmm_lstm_strategy.py` | Enhanced strategy with log-return support |
| `bin/run_hmm_lstm_backtest.bat` / `.sh` | Execution scripts |

### Log Return Scale Configuration

LSTM models trained on log returns output values in the range `[-0.003, +0.003]`. Use these calibrated defaults:

```json
{
  "entry_threshold":    0.001,   // 0.1% predicted log return
  "regime_confidence":  0.4,     // 40% HMM posterior required
  "stop_loss_pct":      0.005,   // 0.5%
  "take_profit_pct":    0.010    // 1.0%
}
```

### Log Return Helpers

```python
# In HMMLSTMStrategy
log_return = math.log(price_t1 / price_t0)
pct_change = math.exp(log_return) - 1.0   # convert back to %
```

### Debugging Checkpoints

- **HMM regime debug**: logs regime predictions and posteriors every 100 bars
- **Signal check debug**: logs why trades aren't triggered every 50 bars

## Knowledge Base — Regime Detection Approaches

### Why Regime Detection Matters

Different strategies perform better in different regimes. Detecting the current regime lets you adapt parameters, switch entry/exit logic, or halt trading entirely in unfavourable conditions.

### Three Approaches

#### 1. Rule-Based (No Training Required)

| Signal | Regime indicator |
|--------|-----------------|
| Short MA > Long MA | Bull |
| Short MA < Long MA | Bear |
| ATR below threshold | Low-volatility / sideways |
| Price breaks support/resistance | Regime change |

#### 2. HMM (Unsupervised, Probabilistic)

HMMs infer hidden market states from observable returns. No labeled data required.

```python
import numpy as np
from hmmlearn.hmm import GaussianHMM

# Fit on log returns
X = np.log(prices / prices.shift(1)).dropna().values.reshape(-1, 1)
model = GaussianHMM(n_components=3, covariance_type="full", n_iter=1000)
model.fit(X)

hidden_states = model.predict(X)        # Most-likely regime sequence
posteriors    = model.predict_proba(X)  # Regime probability at each bar
```

Typical 3-state interpretation: **Bull** (high positive returns) / **Bear** (negative returns) / **Sideways** (returns ≈ 0, low vol).

Use `src/ml/hmm_regime_detector.py`:

```python
from src.ml.hmm_regime_detector import HMMRegimeDetector

detector = HMMRegimeDetector(n_regimes=3)
detector.fit(df["close"])
df["regime"] = detector.predict(df["close"])
```

#### 3. Neural Network (Supervised, Sequence-Aware)

Use labeled regimes from Step 2 (or manual labeling) to train an LSTM classifier:

```python
from src.ml.future.nn_regime_detector import NNRegimeDetector

nn = NNRegimeDetector(input_size=4, n_regimes=3, hidden_size=64, num_layers=2)
nn.fit(features, labels, epochs=100, batch_size=32)
predictions = nn.predict(live_features)
```

**Advantages over HMM:** Captures complex temporal patterns; processes multi-dimensional feature sets (price + volume + indicators); GPU-accelerated.

### Regime-Aware Strategy Pattern

```python
regime = detector.predict_current(bar_features)
if regime == BULL:
    use_trend_following_entry()
elif regime == BEAR:
    skip_long_entries()
elif regime == SIDEWAYS:
    use_mean_reversion_entry()
```
