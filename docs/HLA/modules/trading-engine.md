```python
from src.strategy.base_strategy import BaseStrategy

class CustomStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Strategy initialization
        
    def next(self):
        # Strategy execution logic
        if self.should_enter():
            self.enter_position()
        elif self.should_exit():
            self.exit_position()
```

#### Entry Mixins (Signal Generation)

Entry mixins provide modular, reusable entry logic that can be combined and configured:

**RSIOrBBEntryMixin** - RSI and Bollinger Bands Entry Logic:
```python
# Configuration
{
    "e_rsi_period": 14,
    "e_rsi_oversold": 30,
    "e_bb_period": 20,
    "e_bb_dev": 2.0,
    "e_cooldown_bars": 5
}

# Entry Logic
def should_enter(self) -> bool:
    rsi_condition = self.rsi[0] < self.e_rsi_oversold
    bb_condition = self.data.close[0] <= self.bb.lines.bot[0]
    cooldown_ok = self._check_cooldown()
    return (rsi_condition or bb_condition) and cooldown_ok
```

**Available Entry Mixins:**
- **RSIOrBBEntryMixin**: RSI oversold + Bollinger Band lower touch

    "x_sl_multiplier": 2.0,
    "x_tp_multiplier": 3.0,
    "x_trailing_enabled": true,
    "x_breakeven_enabled": true
}

# Exit Logic
def should_exit(self) -> bool:
    # Update trailing stop
    self._update_trailing_stop()
    
    # Check exit conditions
    return (self.data.close[0] <= self.stop_loss or 
            self.data.close[0] >= self.take_profit)
```

**Available Exit Mixins:**
- **AdvancedATRExitMixin**: Advanced ATR-based trailing stops with breakeven
- **ATRExitMixin**: Basic ATR trailing stop loss

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Strategy Pattern (Entry/Exit Mixins)
The mixin system implements the strategy pattern, allowing dynamic composition of entry and exit logic without inheritance complexity.

### 2. Factory Pattern (Broker Creation)
The broker factory creates appropriate broker instances based on configuration, handling credential selection and mode switching automatically.

### 3. Observer Pattern (Notifications)
The notification system uses the observer pattern to decouple trade events from notification delivery, supporting multiple channels.

### 4. State Machine (Trade Lifecycle)
Trade management implements a state machine pattern to handle complex trade states including partial exits and order modifications.

### 5. Template Method (Base Strategy)
The BaseStrategy uses the template method pattern to define the strategy execution framework while allowing customization of specific steps.
