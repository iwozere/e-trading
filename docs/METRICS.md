Successful trading strategies are evaluated using a set of key metrics that measure profitability, risk, consistency, and efficiency. Here are the most important metrics and typical target values or ranges for a strategy to be considered successful:

## Core Trading Strategy Metrics

| Metric                | Definition/Calculation                                                                 | Target Value/Range         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Win Rate**          | Percentage of profitable trades: (Winning Trades / Total Trades) × 100                | 40–60%[1][2][3]            |
| **Profit Factor**     | Gross profit divided by gross loss                                                    | >1.5–1.75[4][1][5]         |
| **Sharpe Ratio**      | Risk-adjusted return: (Return – Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation                  | >1.0[4][1][6]              |
| **Maximum Drawdown**  | Largest peak-to-trough decline in account value                                       | 1:1 (higher is better)[1][2][3] |
| **Return on Investment (ROI)** | Net profit divided by initial investment, expressed as a percentage               | >15% annually[1][2]        |
| **Average Winner/Loser** | Average profit per winning trade; average loss per losing trade                   | Winner > Loser[8][7][3]    |

## Additional Important Metrics

- **Total Net Profit:** Overall profit after all gains and losses.
- **Number of Trades:** Higher numbers (e.g., >100) increase statistical significance[9].
- **Average Holding Time:** Indicates whether the strategy is short-term or long-term[9].
- **Compound Annual Return (CAR):** Annualized return over time.
- **Risk per Trade:** Typically 1% of account value[1].
- **Position Size:** 0.5–2% per trade[1].

## Summary Table

| Metric                | Target/Range                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Win Rate              | 40–60%                     |
| Profit Factor         | >1.5–1.75                  |
| Sharpe Ratio          | >1.0                       |
| Maximum Drawdown      | 1:1                       |
| ROI                   | >15% annually              |
| Average Winner/Loser  | Winner > Loser             |
| Number of Trades      | >100 (for significance)    |

## Key Insights

- **Profitability and Consistency:** A good strategy should have a positive expectancy, a healthy win rate, and a profit factor above 1.5.
- **Risk Management:** Drawdowns should be controlled (ideally below 20%), and risk per trade should be limited to 1% of account value.
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns:** The Sharpe Ratio should be above 1.0, indicating good risk-adjusted performance.
- **Statistical Significance:** More trades (>100) make performance metrics more reliable.

- Use Multiple Metrics: Don't rely solely on Sharpe ratio. Consider:
- Calmar Ratio: 2.39 (excellent)
- Profit Factor: 1.55 (good)
- Win Rate: 71.8% (excellent)
- SQN: 1.19 (good)
- Adjust Risk-Free Rate: Consider using a lower risk-free rate (0% or 0.5%) for crypto strategies, as traditional risk-free rates may not apply.
- Custom Sharpe Calculation: If you want a more traditional Sharpe ratio, you could:
-- Calculate it manually using only trading days
-- Use simple returns instead of log returns
-- Exclude periods with no trading activity


These metrics, when combined, provide a comprehensive view of a trading strategy’s effectiveness and robustness[4][1][5].
