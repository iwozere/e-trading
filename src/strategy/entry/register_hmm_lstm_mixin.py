"""
Registration script for HMM-LSTM Entry Mixin

This script registers the HMMLSTMEntryMixin with the entry mixin factory
so it can be used with the CustomStrategy framework.

Usage:
    Import this module to automatically register the mixin:

    from src.strategy.entry.register_hmm_lstm_mixin import *

    Or call the registration function explicitly:

    from src.strategy.entry.register_hmm_lstm_mixin import register_hmm_lstm_mixin
    register_hmm_lstm_mixin()
