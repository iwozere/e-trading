Got it 👍 I’ll translate the whole optimization plan into English so you can implement it yourself.

# Current Situation (from your JSON)

* **Win rate ≈ 33%**, **Profit Factor ≈ 0.53**, **Sharpe < 0** → the system is structurally unprofitable.
* Many exits are due to **stop\_hit** and a noticeable portion of losing trades are held too long (“late exits”).
* That confirms your observation: **entries are too early**, and **stops trail too late**.&#x20;

# Entry Fixes (to avoid “too early”)

Currently: entry when RSI ≤ oversold **and** close < lower Bollinger Band. This is classical mean reversion, but it often “catches a falling knife.” Suggested improvements:

1. **Confirmation of reversal**

* **RSI cross upward**: require RSI to cross back above the oversold threshold (e.g. from 29 → 31).
  → Add param `e_rsi_cross=True`. Logic: `rsi[-1] < oversold` and `rsi[0] > oversold`.
* **BB re-entry**: require close > lower BB after touching below.
  → Param `e_bb_reentry=True`.

2. **Trend filter**

* Only take longs if close > SMA/EMA(100–200), shorts if close < SMA/EMA(100–200).
  → Params: `e_trend_filter=True`, `e_trend_ma=200`.
* Or use a higher timeframe (HTF) filter: e.g. only long if daily RSI>50.
  → Params: `e_use_htf=True`, `e_htf='1D'`.

3. **Volatility / signal strength filter**

* **%B (BB percent)**: require `%B < -0.05 … -0.10` **and increasing** (reversal inside the band).
* **ATR filter**: disallow entry when ATR is extremely low (flat) or extremely high (panic).
  → Params: `e_atr_min_quantile`, `e_atr_max_quantile`.

4. **Anti-reentry cooldown**

* Add param `e_cooldown_bars=3–5` to prevent multiple entries in the same impulse.

**Recommended Optuna ranges (entry):**

* `e_rsi_oversold`: 18–32
* `e_bb_dev`: 2.0–3.0
* `e_bb_reentry`: {True/False}, **likely True**
* `e_rsi_cross`: {True/False}, **likely True**
* `e_trend_filter`: {True/False}, **likely True**
* `e_trend_ma`: 100–250
* `e_cooldown_bars`: 2–8

# Exit Fixes (to avoid “too late”)

From JSON: `anchor="mid"`, `k_init≈1.13`, `k_run≈2.87`, `k_phase2≈2.26`, `max_trail_freq=5`, `breakeven_offset_atr≈-0.02`, `update_on="bar_close"`. → This explains late exits and even **negative BE offset** (bad).&#x20;

Recommendations:

1. **Breakeven and arming**

* `arm_at_R`: 0.6–0.9 (now ≈0.98 → too late)
* `breakeven_offset_atr`: **+0.10…+0.30** (never negative)
* `phase2_at_R`: 1.5–2.0

2. **Anchor and trailing frequency**

* `anchor="high"` for longs (instead of "mid") → more aggressive.
* `max_trail_freq=1–2` (currently 5 → too infrequent).
* `update_on="high_low"` (optional) to use intrabar extremes.

3. **ATR multipliers**

* `k_init`: 1.0–1.4
* `k_run`: lower to 1.6–2.1 (instead of 2.87)
* `k_phase2`: 1.1–1.6 (instead of 2.26)

4. **Swing ratchet & tightening**

* Keep `use_swing_ratchet=True` but increase `struct_buffer_atr` to 0.30–0.45.
* Reduce `tighten_if_stagnant_bars` to 12–18 (currently 37).
* `tighten_k_factor`: 0.70–0.85 (currently \~0.81 → fine).

5. **Noise filter and min stop step**

* `noise_filter_atr`: 0.02–0.08 (ok).
* `min_stop_step`: set to \~0.03 (half of your tick size \~0.059). Currently almost zero.

6. **Partial take-profits**

* Keep `pt_levels_R=[1.0, 2.0]`, `pt_sizes=[0.33, 0.33]`.
* Add conditional exit for the remainder if RSI < 50 or close < mid-BB after PT1.

**Recommended Optuna ranges (exit):**

* `k_run`: 1.5–2.2
* `k_phase2`: 1.0–1.7
* `arm_at_R`: 0.5–1.0
* `breakeven_offset_atr`: 0.05–0.35
* `max_trail_freq`: 1–3
* `tighten_if_stagnant_bars`: 10–20
* `tighten_k_factor`: 0.7–0.9
* `min_stop_step`: 0.02–0.06

# Optuna Objective Function (to penalize early/late problems)

Right now, your objective maximizes PnL only → leads to “early entry / late stop.” Add penalties:

```python
score = (
    0.40 * min(sortino, 3.0)       # cap at 3.0
  + 0.25 * min(profit_factor, 2.5) # cap at 2.5
  + 0.15 * (1 - early_entry_rate)  # trades stopped out <=2 bars
  + 0.10 * (1 - late_exit_rate)    # losing trades held >=10 bars
  + 0.10 * win_streak_smoothness   # optional stability metric
)
```

Where:

* `early_entry_rate` = share of losing trades with stop\_hit ≤ 2 bars.
* `late_exit_rate` = share of losing trades held ≥ 10 bars.

This way Optuna will avoid “too early” entries and “too late” exits.

# Checklist Before Re-running

1. Add entry confirmation (RSI cross + BB re-entry) and trend filter.
2. Fix breakeven offset (positive), lower k\_run/k\_phase2, set `anchor="high"`, `max_trail_freq≤2`.
3. Add penalties for early/late exits in Optuna objective.
4. Run walk-forward + OOS validation.
