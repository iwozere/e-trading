# CNN + XGBoost Pipeline Scaling Summary

## Executive Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the recommended scaling strategy for the CNN + XGBoost pipeline, addressing the transition from the current 12 input files to production-ready deployment.

## Current State vs. Target State

### Current State
```
Input Files: 12 (3 symbols × 4 timeframes)
Samples: ~277,524
Training Time: ~30 minutes
Models: 12 CNNs + 4 XGBoost models
Coverage: Limited crypto and stocks
```

### Target State (Production)
```
Input Files: 10,000+ (1000+ symbols × 10+ timeframes)
Samples: ~250,000,000+
Training Time: ~48 hours
Models: 12 specialized CNNs + 4 universal XGBoost models
Coverage: Multi-asset, multi-timeframe, global markets
```
