# Tasks

## Implementation Status

### âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES
- [x] Project structure and directory organization
- [x] Configuration system with YAML loading and validation
- [x] Type-safe configuration data classes
- [x] Logging integration with existing notification system
- [x] Environment variable substitution in configuration
- [x] Comprehensive configuration validation
- [x] Module documentation (README, Requirements, Design, Tasks)

### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Database schema creation and data models
- [ ] Data provider integration layer
- [ ] Core pipeline modules (Universe Loader, Screener, Deep Scan)
- [ ] Scoring and alert system
- [ ] Candidate management system

### ðŸš€ PLANNED ENHANCEMENTS
- [ ] Executable pipeline scripts
- [ ] Reporting and monitoring system
- [ ] Error handling and resilience features
- [ ] Scheduler integration interfaces
- [ ] Performance optimization and validation
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for configuration system
- [ ] Implement configuration hot-reload capability
- [ ] Add configuration schema documentation
- [ ] Create configuration migration utilities

## Known Issues
- Configuration validation could be more granular for nested objects
- Environment variable substitution doesn't support complex expressions
- Logging context inheritance needs testing with concurrent operations

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for ConfigManager class
- [ ] Unit tests for all configuration data classes
- [ ] Integration tests for YAML loading and validation
- [ ] Performance tests for configuration loading
- [ ] Tests for environment variable substitution
- [ ] Tests for logging context management

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] Add configuration parameter reference guide
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common configuration issues
- [ ] Document environment variable requirements
- [ ] Add examples for different deployment scenarios
