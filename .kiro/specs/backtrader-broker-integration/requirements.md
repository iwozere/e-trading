# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the BaseBroker to be used within the backtrader framework by making it inherit from `bt.Broker` instead of `ABC`. This integration will allow seamless use of our enhanced broker functionality (paper trading, notifications, execution metrics) within backtrader strategies and backtesting scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader using backtrader strategies, I want to use the BaseBroker within backtrader, so that I can leverage advanced paper trading features and execution analytics in my backtrader-based strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BaseBroker is used in backtrader THEN it SHALL inherit from bt.Broker instead of ABC
2. WHEN backtrader strategies use BaseBroker THEN all existing paper trading features SHALL remain functional
3. WHEN backtrader calls broker methods THEN the broker SHALL respond with backtrader-compatible data structures
4. WHEN using BaseBroker in backtrader THEN execution metrics and notifications SHALL continue to work

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want backward compatibility with existing broker implementations, so that current trading bots continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing trading bots use BaseBroker THEN they SHALL continue to function without code changes
2. WHEN BaseBroker is used outside backtrader THEN all current functionality SHALL remain intact
3. WHEN switching between backtrader and non-backtrader usage THEN the broker configuration SHALL remain the same
4. IF backtrader is not installed THEN the broker SHALL gracefully handle the missing dependency

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a backtrader user, I want to access enhanced broker features through standard backtrader interfaces, so that I can use familiar backtrader patterns while getting advanced functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backtrader strategies call standard broker methods THEN BaseBroker SHALL implement all required bt.Broker methods
2. WHEN backtrader requests order submission THEN BaseBroker SHALL handle it through the existing place_order method
3. WHEN backtrader queries positions THEN BaseBroker SHALL return data in backtrader-expected format
4. WHEN backtrader accesses portfolio information THEN BaseBroker SHALL provide compatible portfolio data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to use paper trading features within backtrader backtests, so that I can simulate realistic execution conditions during strategy development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running backtrader backtests with BaseBroker THEN paper trading simulation SHALL be available
2. WHEN backtrader executes trades through BaseBroker THEN slippage and latency simulation SHALL apply
3. WHEN backtrader strategies complete THEN execution quality metrics SHALL be available for analysis
4. WHEN using paper trading in backtrader THEN position notifications SHALL be sent as configured

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible broker inheritance options, so that I can choose the appropriate base class based on usage context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backtrader is available and needed THEN BaseBroker SHALL inherit from bt.Broker
2. WHEN backtrader is not needed or available THEN BaseBroker SHALL inherit from ABC
3. WHEN the inheritance choice is made THEN it SHALL be transparent to the user
4. WHEN switching inheritance modes THEN all broker functionality SHALL remain consistent
