# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for a comprehensive web-based user interface to manage the enhanced multi-strategy trading system and Telegram bot operations. The web UI provides dual functionality: trading strategy management and Telegram bot administration through an intuitive, modern web interface.

The system integrates with the enhanced multi-strategy trading service and the existing Telegram bot infrastructure, providing a unified management interface for both trading operations and user communication systems. The implementation includes a FastAPI backend with JWT authentication, role-based access control, and a React frontend with Material-UI components.
