# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Standalone Sentiment Module is a comprehensive, reusable sentiment analysis system that aggregates social media and news sentiment data for financial instruments. This module transforms the existing sentiment functionality from a pipeline-specific component into a general-purpose library that can be imported and used by any system requiring sentiment analysis capabilities.

## Glossary

- **Sentiment_Module**: The standalone sentiment analysis system
- **Adapter**: Individual data source connector (StockTwits, Reddit, Twitter, etc.)
- **Collector**: Main orchestration component that coordinates multiple adapters
- **HF_Pipeline**: HuggingFace transformer-based sentiment analysis pipeline
- **Sentiment_Features**: Standardized output data structure containing all sentiment metrics
- **Data_Quality_Indicator**: Status flag indicating reliability of data from each provider
- **Virality_Index**: Metric measuring viral spread of sentiment across social platforms
- **Bot_Detection**: Algorithm for identifying automated/bot-generated content
