# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the consolidation of multiple redundant indicator-related modules across the e-trading platform into a single, unified indicator service. The current system has significant duplication across `src/common/indicator_service.py`, `src/indicators/`, and `src/strategy/indicator/` modules, leading to maintenance overhead, inconsistent APIs, and fragmented functionality.

The unified indicator service will provide a single source of truth for all technical and fundamental indicator calculations, supporting multiple calculation backends (TA-Lib, pandas-ta, Backtrader) while maintaining backward compatibility and improving performance through unified caching.

## Glossary

- **Unified_Indicator_Service**: The consolidated service that replaces all existing indicator services
- **Technical_Indicator**: Price and volume-based indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- **Fundamental_Indicator**: Company financial metrics (P/E ratio, ROE, debt-to-equity, etc.)
- **Calculation_Backend**: The underlying library used for calculations (TA-Lib, pandas-ta, Backtrader)
- **Adapter_Pattern**: Design pattern allowing multiple backends through a common interface
- **Indicator_Registry**: Centralized catalog of all available indicators and their metadata
- **Configuration_Manager**: System for managing indicator parameters, presets, and mappings

- **Recommendation_Engine**: System that provides trading recommendations based on indicator values
- **Batch_Processing**: Capability to calculate indicators for multiple tickers simultaneously
- **Legacy_Modules**: Existing indicator-related code to be consolidated or removed

3. THE Unified_Indicator_Service SHALL support multi-output indicators (MACD with signal and histogram, Bollinger Bands with upper/middle/lower)
4. THE Indicator_Registry SHALL provide metadata for each indicator including inputs, outputs, and supported backends
5. THE Unified_Indicator_Service SHALL allow dynamic indicator discovery and validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want intelligent recommendations, so that I can receive actionable trading signals based on calculated indicator values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Recommendation_Engine SHALL provide individual recommendations for each calculated indicator
2. THE Recommendation_Engine SHALL generate composite recommendations based on multiple indicators
3. THE Recommendation_Engine SHALL include confidence scores and reasoning for all recommendations
