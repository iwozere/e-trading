# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for an enhanced database-driven trading bot service system that completely replaces JSON configuration files with database-only configuration management. The system will enhance the existing `trading_runner.py` and `strategy_manager.py` to load trading bot configurations from the `trading_bots` database table, spawn multiple bot instances using async operations, support dynamic strategy loading based on strategy type, and integrate with the notification service for trade alerts.

The system will run as a system service that can be started at system startup, providing reliable 24/7 trading bot management with comprehensive monitoring, error handling, and notification capabilities.

## Glossary

- **Trading_Service**: The enhanced trading bot service system that manages multiple bot instances
- **Bot_Instance**: A single trading bot running with specific broker and strategy configuration
- **Strategy_Handler**: Dynamic strategy loader that instantiates different strategy types
- **Notification_Service**: The existing notification service for sending trade alerts
- **Database_Configuration**: Trading bot configuration stored in the trading_bots table
- **Async_Operations**: Asynchronous task-based bot execution within the same process

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database-Only Configuration Loading

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the trading service to load all bot configurations exclusively from the trading_bots database table, so that configuration management is centralized and dynamic without relying on JSON files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trading_Service starts THEN it SHALL load all enabled bot configurations from the trading_bots table
2. WHEN a Database_Configuration is retrieved THEN the Trading_Service SHALL parse the JSON config field and validate all required parameters
3. WHEN the Trading_Service initializes THEN it SHALL completely ignore any JSON configuration files
4. WHEN a bot configuration is invalid THEN the Trading_Service SHALL log the error and skip that bot without affecting others
5. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the Trading_Service SHALL retry connection with exponential backoff and continue running existing bots

### Requirement 2: Async Multi-Bot Instance Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want each trading bot to run as an independent async task within the same process, so that multiple bots can operate concurrently with efficient resource usage and proper isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Trading_Service loads bot configurations THEN it SHALL spawn each enabled bot as a separate async task
2. WHEN a Bot_Instance starts THEN it SHALL run independently using Async_Operations without blocking other bots
3. WHEN a Bot_Instance fails THEN the Trading_Service SHALL isolate the failure and continue running other Bot_Instances
4. WHEN a Bot_Instance completes a trade THEN it SHALL update the database without affecting other running bots
5. WHEN the Trading_Service shuts down THEN it SHALL gracefully stop all Bot_Instances and wait for pending operations to complete

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Strategy Type Loading

**User Story:** As a strategy developer, I want the trading service to dynamically load different strategy types based on configuration, so that I can deploy CustomStrategy, ML-based strategies, and future strategy types without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Database_Configuration specifies a strategy type THEN the Strategy_Handler SHALL dynamically import and instantiate the correct strategy class
2. WHEN the strategy type is "CustomStrategy" THEN the Strategy_Handler SHALL load CustomStrategy with entry/exit mixin parameters
3. WHEN the strategy type is unknown THEN the Strategy_Handler SHALL log an error and fall back to CustomStrategy with a warning
4. WHEN new strategy types are added THEN the Strategy_Handler SHALL support them through a plugin-style architecture
5. WHEN strategy parameters are invalid THEN the Strategy_Handler SHALL validate parameters and provide detailed error messages

### Requirement 4: Integrated Notification System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to receive notifications for buy/sell events from my trading bots, so that I can monitor trading activity in real-time through my preferred communication channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Bot_Instance executes a buy order THEN it SHALL send a notification via the Notification_Service according to the bot's notification configuration
2. WHEN a Bot_Instance executes a sell order THEN it SHALL send a notification via the Notification_Service with trade details and P&L information
3. WHEN a Bot_Instance encounters an error THEN it SHALL send an error notification if error_notifications is enabled in the configuration
4. WHEN notifications are configured THEN the Trading_Service SHALL support email, Telegram, and other channels through the existing Notification_Service
5. WHEN a notification fails to send THEN the Trading_Service SHALL log the failure but continue bot operations without interruption

### Requirement 5: System Service Architecture

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the trading service to run as a system service that starts automatically at system startup, so that trading bots operate reliably 24/7 without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system boots THEN the Trading_Service SHALL start automatically as a system service (systemd on Linux, service on Windows)
2. WHEN the Trading_Service starts THEN it SHALL initialize logging, connect to the database, and load all enabled bot configurations
3. WHEN the Trading_Service is running THEN it SHALL provide health monitoring and status reporting capabilities
4. WHEN the Trading_Service receives a shutdown signal THEN it SHALL gracefully stop all Bot_Instances and clean up resources
5. WHEN the Trading_Service crashes THEN the system SHALL automatically restart it and resume bot operations from the database state

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Trading Runner Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enhance the existing trading_runner.py to support database-driven configuration and multi-bot management, so that the system builds upon proven architecture while adding new capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trading_runner.py is enhanced THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing broker management while adding database configuration loading
2. WHEN the enhanced runner starts THEN it SHALL replace JSON file loading with database queries to the trading_bots table
3. WHEN the enhanced runner manages bots THEN it SHALL use the existing BrokerManager and ConfigManager with database-sourced configurations
4. WHEN the enhanced runner monitors bots THEN it SHALL extend existing monitoring capabilities with database status updates
5. WHEN the enhanced runner shuts down THEN it SHALL use existing graceful shutdown procedures while updating bot status in the database

### Requirement 7: Enhanced Strategy Manager Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enhance the existing strategy_manager.py to support database configurations and async bot management, so that strategy management is unified and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN strategy_manager.py is enhanced THEN it SHALL load strategy configurations from database records instead of JSON files
2. WHEN the enhanced manager creates strategy instances THEN it SHALL use async operations for concurrent bot execution
3. WHEN the enhanced manager handles strategy failures THEN it SHALL implement automatic recovery and error isolation between bots
4. WHEN the enhanced manager monitors strategies THEN it SHALL update bot status and performance metrics in the database
5. WHEN the enhanced manager receives configuration updates THEN it SHALL support hot-reloading of bot configurations without service restart

### Requirement 8: Configuration Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive validation and error handling for bot configurations, so that invalid configurations are detected early and don't cause system instability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Database_Configuration is loaded THEN the Trading_Service SHALL validate all required fields (broker, strategy, symbol, etc.)
2. WHEN broker configuration is invalid THEN the Trading_Service SHALL log detailed validation errors and skip that bot
3. WHEN strategy parameters are invalid THEN the Trading_Service SHALL validate mixin parameters and provide specific error messages
4. WHEN a Bot_Instance encounters runtime errors THEN the Trading_Service SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the Trading_Service SHALL update the bot status in the database and send error notifications if configured

### Requirement 9: Database Integration and State Management

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the trading service to maintain bot state and performance data in the database, so that bot status persists across service restarts and provides historical tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Bot_Instance starts THEN the Trading_Service SHALL update the bot status to 'running' and record the started_at timestamp
2. WHEN a Bot_Instance executes trades THEN the Trading_Service SHALL record trade details in the trading_trades table
3. WHEN a Bot_Instance updates performance THEN the Trading_Service SHALL update current_balance and total_pnl in the trading_bots table
4. WHEN the Trading_Service restarts THEN it SHALL resume bots that were running before shutdown based on database status
5. WHEN a Bot_Instance sends heartbeats THEN the Trading_Service SHALL update the last_heartbeat timestamp for monitoring

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Health Management

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring and health management for all trading bots, so that I can ensure reliable operation and quickly identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bot_Instances are running THEN the Trading_Service SHALL provide real-time status monitoring with health checks
2. WHEN a Bot_Instance becomes unresponsive THEN the Trading_Service SHALL detect the issue and attempt automatic recovery
3. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the Trading_Service SHALL monitor CPU and memory usage and log warnings
4. WHEN the Trading_Service generates logs THEN it SHALL use structured logging with bot IDs and correlation for easy debugging
5. WHEN monitoring data is collected THEN the Trading_Service SHALL provide metrics that can be consumed by external monitoring systems
