# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing the OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data system in the E-Trading Data Module. The system currently handles OHLCV data from multiple providers but needs improvements in data validation, provider selection optimization, cache management, and performance. The enhancement will ensure robust, high-quality OHLCV data delivery for both cryptocurrency and stock trading strategies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced OHLCV Data Validation

**User Story:** As a trading algorithm developer, I want comprehensive OHLCV data validation so that I can trust the data quality for my trading decisions and avoid losses from corrupted or invalid data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OHLCV data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL validate all required columns (open, high, low, close, volume) are present
2. WHEN numeric validation is performed THEN the system SHALL ensure high >= max(open, close) and low <= min(open, close)
3. WHEN timestamp validation is performed THEN the system SHALL check for proper chronological ordering and detect duplicates
4. WHEN data gaps are detected THEN the system SHALL identify missing time periods and provide gap-filling options
5. WHEN data quality scoring is calculated THEN the system SHALL consider completeness, consistency, and logical validity

### Requirement 2: Crypto vs Stock Data Strategy Optimization

**User Story:** As a multi-asset trader, I want the system to handle crypto and stock data differently so that each asset class gets optimal data coverage and provider selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting crypto OHLCV data THEN the system SHALL use crypto-specialized providers (Binance, CoinGecko) with high-frequency capabilities
2. WHEN requesting stock OHLCV data THEN the system SHALL use stock-specialized providers (FMP, Alpaca, Yahoo) with comprehensive market coverage
3. WHEN crypto symbols are detected THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to retrieve fundamentals data
4. WHEN stock symbols are detected THEN the system SHALL support both OHLCV and fundamentals data retrieval
5. WHEN provider selection occurs THEN the system SHALL consider asset class, timeframe, and data quality requirements

### Requirement 3: Advanced Cache Management for OHLCV

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want intelligent OHLCV cache management so that the system maintains optimal performance while ensuring data freshness and storage efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OHLCV data is cached THEN the system SHALL use timeframe-specific TTL (1m: 1min, 1h: 5min, 1d: 30min)
2. WHEN cache validation occurs THEN the system SHALL check data completeness and quality before serving cached data
3. WHEN storage limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent cleanup prioritizing frequently accessed symbols
4. WHEN data gaps are detected in cache THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger gap-filling from providers
5. WHEN cache corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL remove corrupted files and re-fetch data

### Requirement 4: Real-Time Data Integration

**User Story:** As a high-frequency trader, I want seamless integration between historical and real-time OHLCV data so that my strategies can operate continuously without data discontinuities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN real-time data is available THEN the system SHALL seamlessly append it to historical data
2. WHEN real-time feeds disconnect THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and backfill missed data
3. WHEN switching between historical and live data THEN the system SHALL ensure timestamp continuity
4. WHEN multiple timeframes are requested THEN the system SHALL maintain synchronization across all timeframes
5. WHEN data latency is measured THEN real-time updates SHALL arrive within 100ms for crypto and 1s for stocks

### Requirement 5: Provider Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive provider performance monitoring so that I can ensure optimal data quality and identify issues before they impact trading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN provider performance is tracked THEN the system SHALL monitor response times, success rates, and data quality
2. WHEN provider failures are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup providers
3. WHEN data quality degrades THEN the system SHALL alert operators and switch to alternative providers
4. WHEN rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent throttling and load balancing
5. WHEN provider costs are tracked THEN the system SHALL optimize usage to minimize API costs while maintaining quality

### Requirement 6: Multi-Timeframe Data Consistency

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want consistent OHLCV data across multiple timeframes so that my multi-timeframe analysis produces accurate and reliable results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple timeframes are requested THEN the system SHALL ensure data consistency across all timeframes
2. WHEN higher timeframes are calculated THEN the system SHALL derive them from lower timeframe data when possible
3. WHEN data discrepancies are detected THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve inconsistencies
4. WHEN timeframe conversion occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain proper OHLCV aggregation rules
5. WHEN data validation spans timeframes THEN the system SHALL cross-validate data integrity

### Requirement 7: Advanced Gap Detection and Filling

**User Story:** As a backtesting system, I want intelligent gap detection and filling so that my historical analysis is not skewed by missing data points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data gaps are detected THEN the system SHALL classify gaps by type (market hours, weekends, holidays, provider issues)
2. WHEN market hour gaps are found THEN the system SHALL attempt to fill from alternative providers
3. WHEN weekend/holiday gaps are found THEN the system SHALL mark them as expected and not attempt filling
4. WHEN provider outage gaps are detected THEN the system SHALL backfill data once providers are available
5. WHEN gap filling is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain data quality and mark filled data appropriately

### Requirement 8: Symbol-Specific Data Optimization

**User Story:** As a portfolio manager, I want symbol-specific data optimization so that each instrument gets the most appropriate data treatment based on its characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN major crypto pairs are requested THEN the system SHALL use high-frequency providers with minimal latency
2. WHEN altcoin data is requested THEN the system SHALL use providers with comprehensive altcoin coverage
3. WHEN large-cap stocks are requested THEN the system SHALL prioritize data quality and multiple provider validation
4. WHEN small-cap stocks are requested THEN the system SHALL use providers with broad market coverage
5. WHEN international stocks are requested THEN the system SHALL use providers with strong international support

### Requirement 9: Data Quality Scoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a quantitative researcher, I want comprehensive data quality scoring so that I can assess the reliability of my analysis and identify potential data issues.

5. WHEN quality reports are generated THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for improvement

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability Optimization

2. WHEN large datasets are requested THEN the system SHALL implement streaming and pagination for memory efficiency
3. WHEN cache operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms response times for cached data
4. WHEN provider APIs are called THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling and request batching
5. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN memory usage SHALL remain stable under continuous operation

### Requirement 11: Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery
