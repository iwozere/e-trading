# Short Squeeze Detection Pipeline Requirements

## Introduction

The Short Squeeze Detection Pipeline is a comprehensive system that identifies publicly traded companies with high probability of upcoming short squeeze events. The system operates using a hybrid approach combining volume-based detection with official FINRA short interest data. It follows a multi-tier scheduling design with weekly universe scans, bi-weekly FINRA data collection, and daily focused analysis. The system integrates with the existing trading platform's notification, database, and configuration systems.

## Glossary

- **Short_Squeeze_Pipeline**: The complete system for detecting and alerting on potential short squeeze opportunities
- **Universe_Loader**: Weekly component that fetches stock universe data from FMP based on market cap and other criteria
- **FINRA_Collector**: Bi-weekly component that downloads official short interest data from FINRA and stores in ss_finra_short_interest table
- **Volume_Detector**: Component that identifies potential squeeze candidates using volume analysis and momentum indicators
- **Deep_Scan_Module**: Daily component that performs focused analysis on previously identified candidates
- **Candidate_Store**: Database storage system for maintaining screener results and ad-hoc candidates
- **Scoring_Engine**: Component that computes squeeze probability scores based on multiple metrics including volume and FINRA data
- **Alert_Engine**: Component that triggers notifications based on scoring thresholds and cooldown logic
- **FMP_Provider**: Financial Modeling Prep data provider for fundamentals and universe data
- **FINRA_Provider**: Official FINRA data source for short interest reporting
- **Finnhub_Provider**: Finnhub data provider for sentiment, options, and borrow rate data
- **Notification_System**: Existing platform notification infrastructure for Telegram and email alerts
- **Database_System**: Centralized PostgreSQL database system with repository/service pattern for data persistence
- **SS_FINRA_Table**: Database table (ss_finra_short_interest) storing official FINRA short interest data

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to automatically build and maintain a stock universe on a weekly basis, so that I have a comprehensive pool of stocks to analyze for squeeze potential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. THE Universe_Loader SHALL store universe data in Database_System with timestamp and validation metrics
5. THE Universe_Loader SHALL maintain active universe of approximately 3,000 to 5,000 stocks for analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to collect official short interest data from FINRA on a bi-weekly basis, so that I have accurate and authoritative short interest information for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bi-weekly FINRA collector runs, THE FINRA_Collector SHALL download short interest data from FINRA_Provider
2. THE FINRA_Collector SHALL parse FINRA short interest files and extract ticker, short interest shares, and reporting date
3. THE FINRA_Collector SHALL store FINRA data in SS_FINRA_Table with proper data validation
4. THE FINRA_Collector SHALL handle FINRA reporting schedule and download data within 24 hours of publication
5. THE FINRA_Collector SHALL maintain historical FINRA data for trend analysis and comparison

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to identify potential squeeze candidates using volume analysis, so that I can detect squeeze opportunities even when official short interest data is not yet available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the volume detector runs, THE Volume_Detector SHALL analyze volume patterns for stocks in the active universe
2. THE Volume_Detector SHALL calculate volume spike ratio as current volume divided by 20-day average volume
3. THE Volume_Detector SHALL identify stocks with volume spike ratio greater than or equal to 3.0
4. THE Volume_Detector SHALL calculate price momentum indicators including RSI and moving average convergence
5. THE Volume_Detector SHALL store volume-based candidates in Candidate_Store for further analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to perform daily analysis on identified candidates with real-time metrics, so that I can receive timely alerts when squeeze conditions develop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daily deep scan runs, THE Deep_Scan_Module SHALL load active candidates from Candidate_Store
2. THE Deep_Scan_Module SHALL fetch current volume, sentiment, and options data from FMP_Provider and Finnhub_Provider
3. THE Deep_Scan_Module SHALL combine volume analysis with latest FINRA short interest data from SS_FINRA_Table
4. THE Deep_Scan_Module SHALL compute sentiment score from 24-hour news and social media data
5. THE Deep_Scan_Module SHALL calculate call-to-put ratio from options data where available

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to receive alerts when stocks meet specific squeeze criteria, so that I can take action on high-probability opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN squeeze score exceeds high threshold, THE Alert_Engine SHALL trigger high-priority alert via Notification_System
2. WHEN squeeze score exceeds medium threshold, THE Alert_Engine SHALL trigger medium-priority alert via Notification_System
3. IF an alert was sent for a ticker, THEN THE Alert_Engine SHALL enforce 7-day cooldown period before next alert
4. THE Alert_Engine SHALL log all alert events with ticker, level, reason, and timestamp
5. WHERE alert cooldown is active, THE Alert_Engine SHALL only send alerts for higher priority levels

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want to add stocks manually for monitoring when I see unusual activity, so that the system can track them even if they don't meet initial screening criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Short_Squeeze_Pipeline SHALL accept ad-hoc candidate additions with ticker symbol and reason
2. THE Short_Squeeze_Pipeline SHALL store ad-hoc candidates in Candidate_Store with expiration date
3. WHILE ad-hoc candidates are active, THE Deep_Scan_Module SHALL include them in daily analysis
4. THE Short_Squeeze_Pipeline SHALL expire ad-hoc candidates after 7 days unless promoted by screener
5. THE Short_Squeeze_Pipeline SHALL allow manual activation and deactivation of ad-hoc candidates

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all pipeline operations to be configurable and logged, so that I can monitor performance and adjust parameters without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Short_Squeeze_Pipeline SHALL load all thresholds and parameters from YAML configuration file
2. THE Short_Squeeze_Pipeline SHALL log structured events with run_id, module, status, and runtime metrics

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Short_Squeeze_Pipeline SHALL use existing FMP_Provider data downloaders for universe and market data
