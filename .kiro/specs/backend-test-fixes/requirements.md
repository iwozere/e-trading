# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The backend test suite currently has 79 failing tests out of 161 total tests. These failures are caused by missing attributes, incorrect imports, API mismatches, and incomplete implementations. This feature will systematically fix all failing tests to achieve 100% test pass rate.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Authentication and User Model Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all authentication-related tests to pass, so that I can trust the authentication system is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the User model is accessed THEN it SHALL have the telegram_user_id attribute
2. WHEN auth modules are imported THEN they SHALL have all required database service functions
3. WHEN authentication tests run THEN they SHALL pass without AttributeError exceptions
4. WHEN user authentication is tested THEN it SHALL handle both email and telegram_user_id login methods

### Requirement 2: Fix WebSocket Manager Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all WebSocket tests to pass, so that real-time communication features work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocketConnection is tested THEN it SHALL have add_subscription, remove_subscription, has_subscription, and update_last_ping methods
2. WHEN ConnectionManager is used THEN it SHALL be properly aliased to WebSocketManager with correct method signatures
3. WHEN WebSocket tests run THEN they SHALL not have missing attribute errors
4. WHEN message handling is tested THEN it SHALL support all required message types and channels

### Requirement 3: Fix Service Layer Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service tests to pass, so that the business logic layer functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database sessions are accessed THEN they SHALL support context manager protocol (__enter__, __exit__)
2. WHEN async functions are tested THEN they SHALL be properly handled by the test framework
3. WHEN service methods are called THEN they SHALL return expected data structures instead of Mock objects
4. WHEN validation is performed THEN it SHALL match expected error messages and patterns

### Requirement 4: Fix Route and API Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API endpoint tests to pass, so that the web interface works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN route modules are imported THEN they SHALL have all required database and service dependencies
2. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN they SHALL return expected status codes (200, 400, 401, etc.)
3. WHEN error messages are returned THEN they SHALL match expected text patterns
4. WHEN audit logging is tested THEN it SHALL properly track user actions

### Requirement 5: Fix Data Model Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all data model tests to pass, so that data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN User models are accessed THEN they SHALL have consistent field names across all modules
2. WHEN telegram-related data is processed THEN it SHALL use correct field names (telegram_user_id vs user_id)
3. WHEN model relationships are tested THEN they SHALL work correctly with foreign keys
4. WHEN model validation is performed THEN it SHALL enforce all required fields

### Requirement 6: Fix Test Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test infrastructure to support all testing scenarios, so that tests run reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN async tests are run THEN they SHALL be properly supported by pytest
2. WHEN database fixtures are used THEN they SHALL provide proper session management
3. WHEN mocks are used THEN they SHALL return appropriate data types instead of Mock objects
4. WHEN test constants are checked THEN they SHALL match expected enum values
