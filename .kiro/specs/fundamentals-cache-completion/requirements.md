# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for completing the fundamentals cache system in the E-Trading Data Module. The system currently has a well-designed cache infrastructure and combiner logic, but the integration with the DataManager needs completion and enhancement to provide a fully functional fundamentals data retrieval system with intelligent caching, multi-provider support, and robust error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete DataManager Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using the E-Trading platform, I want to retrieve fundamentals data through the DataManager facade so that I can access comprehensive company financial data with automatic caching and provider selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `data_manager.get_fundamentals("AAPL")` THEN the system SHALL return comprehensive fundamentals data from the best available provider
2. WHEN I call `data_manager.get_fundamentals("AAPL", force_refresh=True)` THEN the system SHALL bypass cache and fetch fresh data from providers
3. WHEN I call `data_manager.get_fundamentals("AAPL", providers=["fmp", "yfinance"])` THEN the system SHALL only use the specified providers for data retrieval
4. WHEN I call `data_manager.get_fundamentals("AAPL", combination_strategy="consensus")` THEN the system SHALL combine data using consensus-based field selection
5. WHEN I call `data_manager.get_fundamentals("AAPL", data_type="ratios")` THEN the system SHALL use ratio-specific provider sequence and TTL settings

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Provider Selection Logic

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the fundamentals system to intelligently select providers based on symbol type and data requirements so that data quality and reliability are maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving fundamentals for a US stock THEN the system SHALL use the configured provider sequence from fundamentals.json
2. WHEN retrieving fundamentals for an international stock THEN the system SHALL prioritize providers with good international coverage
3. WHEN a primary provider fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to backup providers in priority order
4. WHEN multiple providers return data THEN the system SHALL combine data using the configured combination strategy
5. WHEN no providers return valid data THEN the system SHALL return an empty dictionary with appropriate logging

### Requirement 3: Robust Error Handling and Retry Logic

**User Story:** As a trading application, I want the fundamentals system to handle provider failures gracefully so that temporary API issues don't break my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider API call fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. WHEN a provider returns invalid data THEN the system SHALL log the issue and try the next provider
3. WHEN all providers fail THEN the system SHALL return cached data if available, otherwise return empty result
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and try alternative providers
5. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts gracefully and continue with available providers

### Requirement 4: Advanced Cache Management

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the fundamentals cache to be self-managing so that it maintains optimal performance and storage efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new fundamentals data is cached THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up stale data for the same symbol and provider
2. WHEN cache TTL expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh data on next request
3. WHEN cache storage exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL clean up oldest data first
4. WHEN data quality is below threshold THEN the system SHALL mark data for refresh and try alternative providers
5. WHEN cache corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL remove corrupted files and fetch fresh data

### Requirement 5: Data Quality Validation and Scoring

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want fundamentals data to be validated for quality so that I can trust the data for financial analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fundamentals data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL validate required fields are present and reasonable
2. WHEN numeric fields are validated THEN the system SHALL check for reasonable ranges (e.g., PE ratio between -1000 and 1000)
3. WHEN data quality score is calculated THEN the system SHALL consider field completeness and value validity
4. WHEN cross-provider validation is enabled THEN the system SHALL compare values across providers and flag significant discrepancies
5. WHEN data fails validation THEN the system SHALL log validation errors and try alternative providers

### Requirement 6: Multi-Provider Data Combination

**User Story:** As a financial data consumer, I want the system to combine data from multiple providers intelligently so that I get the most complete and accurate fundamentals dataset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using priority_based strategy THEN the system SHALL select field values based on provider priority for each specific field
2. WHEN using quality_based strategy THEN the system SHALL select field values from the provider with highest quality score
3. WHEN using consensus strategy THEN the system SHALL average numeric values that are within 10% of each other
4. WHEN field-specific provider priorities exist THEN the system SHALL use field-specific priorities over general provider priorities
5. WHEN combined data is created THEN the system SHALL include metadata about data sources for each field

### Requirement 7: Configuration-Driven Behavior

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure fundamentals behavior through configuration files so that I can adjust provider priorities and TTL settings without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fundamentals.json is updated THEN the system SHALL reload configuration without restart
2. WHEN provider priorities are changed THEN the system SHALL use new priorities for subsequent requests
3. WHEN TTL settings are modified THEN the system SHALL apply new TTL rules to cache validation
4. WHEN field-specific priorities are added THEN the system SHALL use field-specific provider selection
5. WHEN configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to default configuration and log errors

### Requirement 8: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a high-frequency trading system, I want fundamentals data retrieval to be fast and efficient so that it doesn't impact trading performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fundamentals data is cached THEN subsequent requests SHALL return data in under 50ms
2. WHEN multiple symbols are requested THEN the system SHALL support parallel processing
3. WHEN provider APIs are slow THEN the system SHALL implement request timeouts and failover
4. WHEN cache is large THEN the system SHALL maintain fast lookup performance through efficient indexing
5. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading and data cleanup

### Requirement 9: Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want detailed logging of fundamentals operations so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fundamentals data is requested THEN the system SHALL log the request with symbol, providers, and strategy
2. WHEN cache hits occur THEN the system SHALL log cache hit with provider and age information
3. WHEN provider failures occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and retry attempts
4. WHEN data combination occurs THEN the system SHALL log which providers contributed to each field
5. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL log timing information and bottlenecks

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user of the data module, I want the enhanced fundamentals system to be backward compatible so that my existing code continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing code calls provider-specific get_fundamentals methods THEN those methods SHALL continue to work unchanged
2. WHEN existing cache files exist THEN the system SHALL read them correctly and migrate format if needed
3. WHEN configuration files are missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults
4. WHEN API changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for at least one major version
5. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL be optional and not break existing functionality
