# High-Level Architecture Documentation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating comprehensive high-level architecture documentation for the Advanced Trading Framework. The documentation will provide a clear understanding of the system's structure, module responsibilities, data flow, and component relationships for both current and planned features.

## Glossary

- **Trading_Platform**: The complete Advanced Trading Framework system
- **Module**: A distinct functional component of the system (e.g., data, trading, notification)
- **HLA_Documentation**: High-Level Architecture documentation system
- **Component_Diagram**: Visual representation of system components and their relationships
- **Data_Flow_Diagram**: Visual representation of data movement through the system
- **Module_Document**: Individual documentation file for each system module
- **Architecture_Overview**: Main documentation file containing system-wide architecture

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive architecture overview, so that I can understand the entire system structure and component relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL provide a complete system overview in docs/HLA/README.md
2. THE Architecture_Overview SHALL include a high-level component diagram showing all major modules
3. THE Architecture_Overview SHALL describe the overall system purpose and design principles
4. THE Architecture_Overview SHALL list all modules with brief descriptions of their responsibilities
5. THE Architecture_Overview SHALL include data flow diagrams showing information movement between modules

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed module documentation, so that I can understand each module's specific responsibilities and interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL create separate documentation files for each major module
2. WHEN a module document is created, THE HLA_Documentation SHALL include module purpose, responsibilities, and key components
3. THE Module_Document SHALL describe the module's interfaces and integration points with other modules
4. THE Module_Document SHALL include current implementation status and planned enhancements
5. THE Module_Document SHALL follow a consistent documentation template across all modules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to understand data structures and database design, so that I can make informed decisions about system modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL document the PostgreSQL database schema and data access patterns
2. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL describe data models including trading, user management, telegram, and web UI entities
3. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL include information about data providers and sources
4. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL document caching strategies and data flow
5. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL describe the repository pattern and service layer architecture

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand service interactions, so that I can integrate new features or modify existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL document all background services and their responsibilities
2. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL describe service communication patterns and protocols
3. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL include information about the scheduler system and job management
4. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL document notification services and their integration points
5. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL describe API endpoints and web service interfaces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want documentation that includes both current and planned features, so that I can understand the system's evolution path.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL clearly distinguish between implemented and planned features
2. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL include roadmap information for each module
3. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL document migration paths for planned enhancements
4. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL include version information and update timestamps
5. THE HLA_Documentation SHALL provide links between related modules and dependencies
